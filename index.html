            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="standoutContainer">
                <p>Strange Depths is a three person indie game studio currently working on our first game
                    "Life
                    Light: Glyph"! Having all met online relatively recently we're still
                    getting
                    to know eachother but the chemistry is there!
                    <br><br>
                    "Life Light: Glyph" is a project that has a very long history
                    of which you can learn about in our first devlog and YouTube video! Our current goal is to have a
                    playable
                    demo out by mid December of this year (2025) but we want it to be as good as possible so if we think
                    it needs more time, we will do so.
                    <br><br>
                    Join us in our Discord server to witness our behind the scenes and participate in the playtesting!
                    If
                    you'd like to support us you can do so through our Kickstarter!

                        all eras of gaming like 007, Resident Evil, The Elder Scrolls, The Legend of Zelda, Minecraft,
                        plus newer titles like Hollow Knight, Celeste, Journey, etc. and diving into anything and
                        everything tech related I could since I was young coupled with having done artwork and
                        programming for
                        various other indie game projects in the past, I decided it was time to try
                        my hand at running my own game studio. <br><br>I do all sides of game dev including art, level
                        design,
                        music (kinda), sfx, programming, writing, etc.

                        all forms of artistic avenues with character design, graphic design, animation, 3D models, world
                        building, digital painting, and more recently, pixel art! <br><br>Video games have been
                        something I grew
                        up with, starting way back with the game boy colour, to game cube, then xbox, and now high end
                        PC gaming. Ending up in game design was truly a matter of time, combining all those creative
                        skills into a the labour of passion that is indie game development.
